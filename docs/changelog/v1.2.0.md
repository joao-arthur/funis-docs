# v1.2.0

## New

- **chr**
  - **throttle** and **debounce** now return the _timeout id_ in case you need to cancel the timeout
    completely.

## Breaking changes

- **arr**
  - **first** and **last** removed in favor of _Array.prototype.at_
  - **sort** removed in favor of _Array.prototype.toSorted_
  - **combinate** renamed to **combinate**
- **map**
  - **first** and **last** removed in favor of _Array.prototype.at_, since you can easily retrieve
    _Map_ entries as arrays.
